Steps necessary to run this graph engine's ttc'17 solution to the State Elimination Case:
1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to branch ttc-state
3. Assemble with gradle, i.e. run ./gradlew assemble (do not build, it will run the tests which takes really long!)
4. Import in Eclipse
5. Run /org.fujaba.graphengine/src/test/java/org/fujaba/graphengine/unitTests/TestTTCStateCase.java for test results.
